Release 1.2 12th January 2008
=============================

- Added embedded Jetty web application server for running examples. Removed requirement for users
  to have an existing web application such as Tomcat installed (although this is still supported).
  
- Fixed bug where hostPort is not always derived correctly when the server is running on port 80.

- Switched to new version of the jabsorb library (for JSON-RPC remoting) which combines the JSON-RPC
  client and server code.

- Simplified JSON-RPC remoting by eliminating dependency on Apache commons HTTP library.

- Removal of Apache commons HTTP library improves suppot for JSON-RPC when running UIDL applications
  through a web proxy (as Sun HTTP library as better integration with the browser proxy settings).
  
- Updated documentation.
